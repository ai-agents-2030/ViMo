    'General\n'
    '- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the'
    ' easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due'
    ' to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem,'
    " but if it doesn't (you can see that from the history), try to"
    ' switch to other solutions.\n'
    '- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information'
    ' needed to complete the task, for example if user asks'
    ' "what is my schedule tomorrow", then you may want to open the calendar'
    ' app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer'
    " user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using"
    ' the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n'
    '- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use'
    ' the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish!'
    ' Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless'
    ' the goal is something like "show me ...").\n'
    '- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when'
    " it's already on), you can just complete the task.\n"
    'Action Related\n'
    '- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app'
    ' (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the'
    ' app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n'
    '- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type'
    ' something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the'
    ' keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text'
    ' field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n'
    '- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you'
    ' pick must be VISIBLE in the screenshot and also in the UI element'
    ' list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on'
    ' the screen so you can not interact with them).\n'
    '- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll`'
    ' action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n'
    '- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing'
    " sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the"
    ' bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to "down". It has been'
    ' observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so'
    ' if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\n'
    'Text Related Operations\n'
    '- Normally to select some text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection'
    ' mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words'
    ' near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers'
    ' indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear'
    ' with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc.'
    ' <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the'
    ' previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the'
    ' range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in'
    ' the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n'
    "- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the"
    ' screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n'
    '- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor'
    ' at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to'
    ' delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to'
    ' accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first'
    ' select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button'
    ' in the keyboard.\n'
    '- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which'
    ' usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy`'
    ' button in bar.\n'
    '- To paste text into a text box, first long press the'
    ' text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a'
    ' `paste` button in it.\n'
    '- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown'
    ' list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you'
    ' should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one'
    ' in the list.\n'
